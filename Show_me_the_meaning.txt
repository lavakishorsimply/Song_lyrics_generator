                                            Of being lonely
                                            So many words
                                            For the broken heart
                                            It's hard to see
                                            In a crimson love
                                            So hard to breathe
                                            Walk with me, and maybe...
                                            Nights of light
                                            So soon become
                                            Wild and free
                                            I can feel the Sun
                                            Your every wish

                                            They never say

                                            Guilty roads
